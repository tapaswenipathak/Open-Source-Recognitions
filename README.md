# Open-Source-Recognitions

A list having recognitions based on improvements done in open source communities. 

Being a lover of transparency, for a bigger and large scale impact I am initiating a crowdsourced list where I would like the enlisiting of recoginitions/awards present in open source communities; listing past awardees. The repository also makes public how you can be a maintainer, admin and take the largest responsibilities like community service and board membership in open source organisations.
